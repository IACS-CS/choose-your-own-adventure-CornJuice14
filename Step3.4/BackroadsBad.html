    <h1>Driving: Backroads</h1>
    <p>Your red shirt catches the attention of a garbage truck. He stops looking where he's going 
      and crashes into a telephone pole. Garbage is sent flying everywhere. Some of it breaks your 
      front windshield and ruins your shirt. You get to school somehow and your classmates call you 
      "stinky" for the rest of your time at school. You go broke due to having to fix your car, and you
      now live behind a dumpster.</p>
