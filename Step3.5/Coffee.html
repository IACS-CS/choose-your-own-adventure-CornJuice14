    <h1>Coffee?: Yes</h1>
    <p>You grab some nice hot coffee, and make your way to school. On your way, you hit a pot hole and
       your coffee spills all over you and your car. It burns you so bad that you lose control of the 
       car and crash into a Burger King. You go to jail for reckless driving.</p>
