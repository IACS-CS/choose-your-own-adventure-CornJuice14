    <h1>Toothpaste: Cherry</h1>
    <p>The toothpaste stains your teeth red! You try to wash off the red, but it won't come out. 
      Your brother, hearing you make a commotion about your teeth, 
      barges into the bathroom to find out what's going on. He sees your dilema and hands you 
      a white tank top. He whispers a funny prank idea to you. You grab your stuff and head into your car.</p>
